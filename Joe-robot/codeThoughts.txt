The zeroing of the motors seems to be bound to the absolute encoders
however as far as i can tell, it does not actually use those values whatsoever when turning
If current solution does not work try this:
have the zeros be retrieved using the 
"zeroEncoder()" function's method of 
sparkPosition = 360 - neoPosition + self.encoderOffset
with neoPosition simply being the encoderBoundedPosition
just take this and take away the offset
